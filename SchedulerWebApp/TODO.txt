    (in picker HTML) - set default datetime to today's date 8am for start, end time for 5pm for end

    in script - 
        make date update one another upon select (possibly in onChangeDateTime function)
        make time update to set min/max of the other upon select

    update - 
        removing end date picker. work on script to check selected date => 
            if selected date is today, mintime is 0 (now).
